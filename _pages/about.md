Hello, my name is Prashant Gurung. I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal, but immigrated to the United States of America when I was around 13 years old. Since then, I've called Michigan my new home. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Michigan State University. I chose to major in CS because I believe technology has been driving innovation and impacting the world, and I want to be part of it. I have experience in Python and C++, with more languages to be added to my experience in the future. My former employers have mentioned that I have a strong work ethic and am great at communicating with co-workers or customers.
